# lab-02-Modules-and-Testing

**Author**: Joseph Hangarter

**Version**: 1.0.5

## Overview
* Create a function called fibonacci. The function should have one parameter n. The function should return the nth value in the fibonacci series.
* Create a function called lucas that takes in one parameter and executes the same function as the fibonacci, but with the first index as 2, and second index as 1.
* Create a function called sum_series with one required parameter and two optional parameters. The required parameter will determine which element in the series to print. The two optional parameters will have default values of 0 and 1 and will determine the first two values for the series to be produced. Calling this function with no optional parameters will produce numbers from the fibonacci series. Calling it with the optional arguments 2 and 1 will produce values from the lucas numbers. Other values for the optional parameters will produce other series.
